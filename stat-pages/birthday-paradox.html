        Think of a random group of 23 people — maybe in classroom, a work
        meeting, or a party. Now guess: What do you think the chances are that 2
        individuals share the same birthday? <br />
        <br />If you'd imagine the probabilities to be pretty low — say 10%,
        20%, or even less — <strong>you'd be wrong.</strong> <br />
        In fact, if you guessed anything under 50%, you are wrong. <br />
        <br /> Welcome to <strong>The Birthday Paradox</strong>

      <h2>Try It Yourself!</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Use the slider to choose how many people to generate, then hit the
        button. Their birthdays are randomly generated dates in a nonleap year.
        Watch as matching birthdays light up in yellow. The odds might
        surprise you!
