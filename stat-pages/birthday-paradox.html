        Think of a random group of 23 people — maybe in classroom, a work meeting, or a party.
        Now guess: What do you think the chances are that 2 individuals share the same 
        birthday? 
        <br>If you'd imagine the probabilities to be pretty low 
        — say 10%, 20%, or even less — <strong>you'd be wrong.</strong>
        <br>The answer is over 50%.
