        Think of a random group of 23 people — maybe in classroom, a work
        meeting, or a party. Now guess: What do you think the chances are that 2
        individuals share the same birthday?
        <br />If you'd imagine the probabilities to be pretty low — say 10%,
        20%, or even less — <strong>you'd be wrong.</strong> <br />The answer is
        over 50%.
